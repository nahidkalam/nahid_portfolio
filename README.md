# Nahid Kalam Portfolio â€” Complete Project

This is the full Vite + React + Tailwind project with your **entire portfolio code** wired into `src/App.tsx`.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

## Notes
- Minimal `@/components/ui/button` and `@/components/ui/card` are included to match your imports. You can later replace them with shadcn/ui if you want.
- Tailwind dark mode is set to `class` and configs use CommonJS to avoid Node ESM issues.
